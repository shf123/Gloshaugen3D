After resizing all the texture images to a size of type 2^x, in this case
128x128, most of the texture drawing issues disappeared. 
On Hovedbygget, a two parts of the roof is still missing.
The first is "Glasstaket-til-fronten-og-bakre-toppm_ne.jpg"
and either "Topptrekant-p_-siden-av-hovedbygget.jpg" or 
"Topptrekant-p_-siden-av-hovedbygget_0.jpg"
