Gloshaugen3D
============
Visualization of Gløshaugen as part of my master thesis.<br>
Terrain data from kartverket is used, and the 3D-models of 
the buildings in Gløshaugen were made by students at NTNU.

Oculus Rift support will be added later.


Some url options: <br>
useStoredTexture = true : not use WMS <br>
model = obj : use 3d-models in .obj format(only hovedbygget now) <br>
model = js : use 3d-models in .js format <br>
model = \<anything else\> : use 3d-models in .dae format. (most files in this format) <br>
norgeIBilder = true : use ortofoto instead of "normal map texture" <br>
