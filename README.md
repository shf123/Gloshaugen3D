============
Visualization of Gløshaugen as part of my master thesis.<br>
Terrain data from kartverket is used, and the 3D-models of 
the buildings in Gløshaugen were made by students at NTNU.


Some url options: <br>
useStoredTexture = true : not use WMS <br>

model = js : use 3d-models in .js format. (Recommended) <br>
model = obj : use 3d-models in .obj format. <br>
model = none : no buildings. <br>
model = \<anything else\> : use 3d-models in .dae format. <br>
greyBuildingColors = true : use grey colors on buildings instead of the textures. <br>
shrinked = true : use shrunked versions of the textures. <br>
